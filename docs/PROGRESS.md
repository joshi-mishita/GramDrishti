## Current state
S0: repo skeleton, README, contribution rules, PR template, CI.

S1: `backend/` package `gramdrishti` with `pyproject.toml` (ruff and pytest config). Built:
- `data/config.py`: DATA_MODE, paths, VARS, COLS, LEADS, windows, season groups, and `select_window`, which refuses TEST.
- `data/loaders.py`: one loader per file, the same columns in mock and real mode. `load_truth()` and `load_block_truth()` raise `RealModeError` in real mode.
- `data/qc.py`: range, consistency, spike, stuck-sensor and missing flags, plus `clean_values` and `qc_summary` for the later `/data-quality` endpoint.
- `models/bias.py` and `models/baselines.py`: B0, B1 and B2.
- `verify/metrics.py` and `verify/baseline_report.py`.
- 64 tests.

CI now runs the backend job and regenerates the oracle first. The generator's default output is `data/`. It reproduces the committed files with seed 42.

## Decisions
- D001 Licence MIT.
- D002 Mock data flattened into `data/`; zip and `synthetic_oracle/` git-ignored.
- D003 CI detect job skips missing halves.
- D004 B2 station offsets: static per-station, per-season offsets fitted on TRAIN, IDW, own station excluded.
- D005 Bias target: block truth in mock mode, station block means in real mode.
- D006 Season groups; wind ratio of sums; inverse-MSE weights per variable and lead.
- D007 Rain QM edge cases.
- D008 Real data in `data/real/`, same columns.
- D009 TEST window guard in code.
- D010 Generator default OUT and CI oracle regeneration.
- D011 Dependencies with minimum versions, pin in S14.
- D012 QC edge cases.

## Not verified
- S0: Mermaid checked with the mermaid parser locally, not seen rendered on GitHub.
- S1: CI has not run on GitHub from this session (no `gh`); check the pull request's checks. That includes the oracle regeneration step and the generator reproduction test on Linux with Python 3.11. Local runs used Python 3.13.9, pandas 3.0.6 and numpy 2.5.3 on macOS.
- S1: real mode was tested only with copies of mock files under `data/real/` (column and dtype equality). No real data exists.
- S1: B2 IDW and lapse terms are unit-tested on hand-made data. Their effect on the mock data is small because mock elevations vary by only about 8 m.

## Known issues
- `gh` CLI not installed, so pull requests are opened by hand from the compare URL.
- `data/synthetic_oracle/` is git-ignored: a fresh clone must run `python data/generate_mock_data.py` (the default output is now `data/`).
- `mock_data_summary.json` regenerates with one float differing in the 16th significant digit (`tmin_std_c_mean`), because summation order differs across numpy versions. All CSV and GeoJSON files are byte-identical.
- The S1 baseline report on CALIB (data description only): B1 rain RMSE is higher than B0 at leads 1 and 2. B1 RH bias is +0.75 to +1.19 % at leads 3 and 4 while B0 is -0.65 to -0.01 %. B2 differs from B1 by at most a few hundredths for temperature. B1 corrected wet-day frequency is 0.112 to 0.134 against block truth 0.103.
- `data/README.md` said 14 AWS + 10 ARG. The file has 12 + 12, and the README is now corrected.

## Inputs needed from the team
- Enable branch protection on `main` (require pull request, require CI).
- Later: expert threshold review (S8), native Hindi/Punjabi review (S3, S13).

## Model and validation log
| Date | Model version | Windows used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-24 | baselines B0/B1/B2 (S1) | fit TRAIN, scored CALIB | `python -m gramdrishti.verify.baseline_report`. TEST window opened: never |

## Handoff for the next session
S1 is complete once its PR is merged. Next backend session: S2 (contract and API skeleton). S3 (frontend) can run in parallel.

For S5, reuse `Baselines.predict(fc)` for the B0 to B2 comparison, `apply_bias` plus `combine_sources` for the corrected block forecast and spread features, and `select_window` for all splits. The purge of lead-day windows at split edges (guide 6.2) is not implemented yet because S1 needs none: bias fitting uses valid dates inside TRAIN only.
